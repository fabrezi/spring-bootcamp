## Spring-Bootcamp

The purpose of this repository was to train a programmer on Spring framework. The pre-requisite of Spring 
is Java programming language. This repository is designed to cover the fundamentals of Java to speed-up the 
user to learn Spring efficiently. Another purpose of the `bootcamp` is to find a methodology to learn a new programming language. This will allow
user to fathom, understand and start coding in a particular program. Overall, the goal of the repository is to give
an overview of Java and training exercises to learn Spring framework for web-development.

## Short History of Java

Java programming language came into existence through the work of James Gosling in 1994. He was working at Sun 
Microsystems at the time. 

## Java Compiler & JVM

Compiler is a program that translates source code (high-level language) into machine code, bytecode or another 
programming language. 

JVM is the java virtual machine which allows any machine to run java bytecode. Bytecode are instructions 
which dictates the VM of how to process the code into machine code.

`.java` file is the code file. `.class` file is the compiled file.

NOTE: javac expects a FILENAME(sum.java) while java expects a CLASSNAME(sum). 

`javac herb.java`

`java herb`

OUTPUT == WEED IS LIFE!!

Compiler checks the syntax of the source code and compiles it into bytecode.
JVM Loads the bytecode and executes it. This gives us the output.

## Java Versions
Currently I am using `Java 21`.

## Java Data Types
A type is a set of values and operations on them. A type is either a primitive or reference type.

Boolean (true and false)
byte (8-bit): 128
short (16 bit): 32767
int (32 bit): 1237120931023701
long (64-bit): ....
float (32-bit): ....
double (64-bit): ...
char (16-bit): This contains the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters. This starts
               with ''.

There are two data types: primitive types and reference types.

Primitive types are NOT objects and are directly stored in the 
memory.
