## Spring-Bootcamp

The purpose of this repository was to train a programmer on Spring framework. The pre-requisite of Spring 
is Java programming language. This repository is designed to cover the fundamentals of Java to speed-up the 
user to learn Spring efficiently. Another purpose of the `bootcamp` is to find a methodology to learn a new programming language. This will allow
user to fathom, understand and start coding in a particular program. Overall, the goal of the repository is to give
an overview of Java and training exercises to learn Spring framework for web-development.

## Short History of Java

Java programming language came into existence through the work of James Gosling in 1994. He was working at Sun 
Microsystems at the time. 

## Java Compiler & JVM

Compiler is a program that translates source code (high-level language) into machine code, bytecode or another 
programming language. 

JVM is the java virtual machine which allows any machine to run java bytecode. Bytecode are instructions 
which dictates the VM of how to process the code into machine code.

`.java` file is the code file. `.class` file is the compiled file.

NOTE: javac expects a FILENAME(sum.java) while java expects a CLASSNAME(sum). 

`javac herb.java`

`java herb`

OUTPUT == WEED IS LIFE!!

Compiler checks the syntax of the source code and compiles it into bytecode.
JVM Loads the bytecode and executes it. This gives us the output.

## Concepts

- Reserved-Words: Identifiers that have special meaning, such as: abstract, enum, goto, public etc.
- `Syntax rules dicates the form of the program. Semantics is the meaning of the program.`

## Interview Questions

- What is the difference between `String` and `StringBuffer`.
A: StringBuffer is changeable while String class is unchangeable once it has been initialized.
